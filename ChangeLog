	* fix configure script for Darwin

2010-09-24 Devin Bayer <dbayer@ripe.net> v1.4.99.12
	* Remove --disable-ipv6 flag
        * Fix parsing of IPv6 NEXT_HOP attributes
        * Add clearer command-line options
        * Add logging to STDERR
        * Add dumping to files instead of STDOUT
        * Add regression test suite

2009-11-24 Roman Kalyakin <roman@ripe.net> v1.4.99.11
	* Fixed incorrect output when running with -m which was
	  introduced by a change in one of the previous versions.
	  (issue IS-439)

2009-10-13 Ruben van Staveren <ruben@ripe.net>
	* Fix segfaults with empty AS path on -m/-M 
	  (issue IS-292)
	  Patch contributed by Lorenzo Colitti <lorenzo@google.com> 

2009-07-29 Erik Romijn <eromijn@ripe.net>
	* Fixing incorrect as path length count in case of AS_(CONFED_)SEQUENCE
	  (issue IS-141)
	  Patch contributed by Toby Ehrenkranz <tehrenkr@cs.uoregon.edu>
	* Added support for the ORIGINATOR_ID and CLUSTER_LIST attributes
	  (issue IS-181)
	  Patch contributed by Maurizio Pizzonia <pizzonia@dia.uniroma3.it>
	* Fixed signedness of MED and localpref (issue IS-180)
	  Patch contributed by Steve Hill <cheesy@sackheads.org>
	* Implemented conditional checking for compression libraries (issue IS-179)
	  Patch contributed by Steve Hill <cheesy@sackheads.org>

2009-07-27 Ruben van Staveren <ruben@ripe.net>
	* Enabled extra compiler warnings
	* Fixed some potentially unsafe constructs (pointer arithmetic,
	  signed/unsigned comparisons, shadowed variables) 

2009-07-22 Ruben van Staveren <ruben@ripe.net>
	* Fixed a case where during -M dumps aspaths where printed for entries that
	  did not have their BGP_ATTR_AS_PATH flag set. Such entries will now print
	  an empty field. Reported by many people.

	* Fixed a bug causing segfaults on processing some MP_REACH_NLRI's

2007-03-09 Erik Romijn <eromijn@ripe.net>
	* Updated TABLE_DUMP_V2 support to comply with draft-ietf-grow-mrt-04

2007-03-07 Erik Romijn <eromijn@ripe.net>

	* Implement ASN32 support

2005-11-08 Young Hyun <youngh@caida.org>
	* IPv6 prefixes were not printed properly by bgpdump.

2004-02-10 Lorenzo Colitti <lorenzo@ripe.net>
	* Fix a stupid crash when reading truncated prefixes.

2004-02-09 Lorenzo Colitti <lorenzo@ripe.net>
	* Decode unknown attributes properly.
	* Fix a crash when reading truncated prefixes.

2004-02-04 Hong-wei Kong  <hong-wei_kong@agilent.com>
        * Add a new option (-t dump|change) to bgpdump. If '-t dump' is 
	  specified, then the decoding result with '-m' / '-M' option will
	  show the timestamp when these routes are dumped. If '-t change' is
	  specified, then the decoding result with '-m' / '-M' option will
	  show the timestamp when the routes were last time changed. This 
	  option only works with routing table dumps.

2004-01-16 Lorenzo Colitti <lorenzo@ripe.net>
	* Fix compile errors under cygwin (only IPv4 works though)

2003-12-18 Hong-Wei Kong <hong-wei_kong@agilent.com>
	* Added support for dumping BGP routing table entries in
	  machine-readable format (-m). Previously -m was only supported
	  for BGP messages

2003-12-16 Shufu Mao <msf98@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn>
	* Revised the decoding of BGP routing table dump to make the result
	  identical to route_btoa

2003-12-15  Lorenzo Colitti <lorenzo@ripe.net>
	* Proper autoconf support: check for features instead of target
	  systems, remove extra .h files and only use configure.in, use
	  Makefile.in instead of Make.include, link both static and
	  shared library, check for ar and ranlib, etc.
	* Changed INET6 to BGPDUMP_HAVE_IPV6
	  (N.B. Docs are not updated yet)
	* Fixed possible endianness issues on Sparc.
	* Fixed a crash while decoding NOTIFICATION messages

2003-11-26  Shufu Mao <msf98@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn>

	* Workaround for zebra "NOIP" bug
	* Preliminary autoconf support (./configure; make)
	* Added option to disable IPv6. If this option is specified to
	  ./configure, the library is compiled without IPv6 support.
	  The default is to turn on IPv6 if the necessary headers are
	  available.

2003-11-25  Lorenzo Colitti <lorenzo@ripe.net>

	* Added support for OPEN and NOTIFICATION messages.
	* Better workarounds for corrupt data produced by zebra/quagga bugs.
	* The library now keeps track of how many records were parsed and how
	  many were successfully parsed.
	* Better error reporting. Now an error will be logged through syslog
	  whenever a record cannot be decoded.
	* Agilent Labs contributed bgpdump, a tool which emulates route_btoa
	  using libbgpdump. This should be a drop-in replacement for people
	  currently using route_btoa and supports IPv6 on all platforms.

2003-10-15  Lorenzo Colitti <lorenzo@ripe.net>

	* 1.3.1 beta released
	* Added support for reading from gzipped input files and gzipped stdin.
	  NOTE: this means you must now link with zlib!
	* Changed Makefile to build a shared library by default.
	* Renamed test program from test2 to testbgpdump.

2003-10-15  Lorenzo Colitti <lorenzo@ripe.net>

	* 1.3 beta released
	* Added IPv6 support. Note that this changes some interfaces!
	  See README.ipv6 for details.
	* Set announce and withdraw arrays to NULL to avoid segfaults if there
	  is a parse error.
	* Change mstream behaviour so it always returns zero bytes if reading
	  past the end of a packet. This eliminates non-deterministic
	  behaviour (random segfaults, infinite loops, ...) when parsing
	  corrupt data, including the consequences of the zebra "update packet
	  truncated at 4096 bytes" bug.
	* Other fixes to handle corrupt data better.
	* Other miscellaneous fixes.
