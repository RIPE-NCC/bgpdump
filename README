This is libbgpdump - a C library designed to help with analyzing dump
files produced by Zebra/Quagga or MRT.



=== SUPPORTED INPUT FORMAT ===

- MRT RIB dump
- Zebra/Quagga format
- These may be gzipped and/or passed in through stdin

- MRT routing table dump entries in TABLE_DUMP or TABLE_DUMP_V2 types
- Zebra/Quagga BGP records:
	- BGP messages (OPEN, UPDATE, NOTIFY, KEEPALIVE)
	- BGP state changes



=== COMPILING ===

- ./configure [--disable-ipv6] ; make
- Note that IPv6 is enabled by default, and if the library has IPv6
  support your application must be able to handle or ignore the resulting
  IPv6 data!
- libbgpdump should compile on Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and Cygwin



=== HOW TO USE THE LIBRARY YOURSELF ===

- include the file bgpdump_lib.h
- call bgpdump_open_dump() to open desired Zebra/MRT dump/update file
- call bgpdump_read_next() to read an entry
- analyze the entry
- call bgdump_free_mem() to free up memory allocated by bgpdump_read_next()
- repeat last 3 steps until EOF of input
- call bgdump_close_dump() to close the dump file

Please see bgdump_formats.h for a description of data structures used.

An example is included - test.c - it lists all the information gathered
from a dump/update file given as a command line parameter.



=== NOTES ON TABLE_DUMP_V2 ===

You might note that there are some strange loops in the code handling
TABLE_DUMP_V2. The reason for this is that for one prefix, there is
always only one TABLE_DUMP_V2 entry, possibly with multiple peers and
atrributes. To keep output consistent, the code loops through every
peer/attribute set and prints the prefix every time.
As the code around the type-specific parsing usually prints out
timestamps and newlines to seperate entries, this is done
in these small loops too.

Also, TABLE_DUMP_V2 was not finished yet when it was added to libbgpdump.
Libbgpdump supports the format as defined in draft-ietf-grow-mrt-04,
with the following exceptions:
- INDEX_TABLE is named PEER_INDEX_TABLE in the code
- BGP4MP_STATE_CHANGE_AS4 exists, it's like BGP4MP_STATE_CHANGE with a
  4-byte AS field. Note that it's subtype is mentioned in section 5.9.
- RIB_GENERIC and the multicast RIBs are not supported. IPv4 and IPv6
  unicast prefixes will only be read from RIB_IPV4_UNICAST and
  RIB_IPV6_UNICAST entries.

As RIB_GENERIC may be supported in later versions and may then also
contain IPv4 or IPv6 unicast prefixes, code using the library should
check the address family by reading the contents of:
  entry->body.mrtd_table_dump_v2_prefix.afi
for AFI_IP or AFI_IP6 and *NOT* checking the contents of
  entry->subtype
for BGPDUMP_SUBTYPE_TABLE_DUMP_V2_RIB_IPV4_UNICAST etc.
