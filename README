This is libbgpdump - a C library designed to help with analyzing dump
files produced by Zebra/Quagga or MRT.

File formats:
    - MRT RIB dump
    - Zebra/Quagga format
    - These may be gzipped and/or passed in through stdin

Entry formats:
    - MRT routing table dump entries
    - Zebra/Quagga BGP records:
          - BGP messages (OPEN, UPDATE, NOTIFY, KEEPALIVE)
          - BGP state changes

How to compile:
    - ./configure [--disable-ipv6] ; make
    - Note that IPv6 is enabled by default, and if the library has IPv6
      support your application must be able to handle or ignore the resulting
      IPv6 data!
    - libbgpdump should compile on Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and Cygwin

How to use the library:

- include the file bgpdump_lib.h
- call bgpdump_open_dump() to open desired Zebra/MRT dump/update file
- call bgpdump_read_next() to read an entry
- analyze the entry
- call bgdump_free_mem() to free up memory allocated by bgpdump_read_next()
- repeat last 3 steps until EOF of input
- call bgdump_close_dump() to close the dump file

Please see bgdump_formats.h for a description of data structures used.

An example is included - test.c - it lists all the information gathered
from a dump/update file given as a command line parameter.
